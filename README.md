# Burger Builder

My implementation of course project from "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

This single-page application helps to build and order a custom burger. 

Features interactive burger styled entirely with CSS classes, user authorization (with user data stored in Firebase database), checkout page with the form to fill with delivery info, list of orders by respective user.

The app was built using React **(with React Hooks)**, React Router, Redux, Redux Thunk (middleware), Axios (promise based HTTP client), CSS Modules, Animate.css.

## Index Page 
Ingredients are sourced from Firebase and appear with animated effects from Animate.css.
